## Health check — how to tell it's alive

1. **This file's "last completed cycle" date** should never be more than ~4 days old
   (weekend cycles still update it — the agent runs and reconciles even when the
   market is closed).
2. **`HEALTH.log`** — one line per run. A missing line for a scheduled fire, or a
   `START` line with no matching `OK`, means a run died mid-way.
3. **Git history of this branch** — every cycle ends in a commit named `Cycle N: …`.
4. **Robinhood app** → Agentic account (••••6885) → order history. Every order the
   agent places is tagged as agent-placed on Robinhood's side.

⚠️ **If checking from a local clone: `git fetch` first.** A stale local clone falsely
looks like the agent stopped (this exact false alarm happened 2026-08-05).

## Recent runs

| Date (UTC) | Cycle | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-11 | 12 | ✅ No trades — cash near top of band; LIN fundamentals strengthened (record backlog, raised guide) but still below 50-day SMA; AMT/CAT unchanged, no re-entry |
| 2026-08-07 | 11 | ✅ No trades — cash in band; LIN/AMT still below 50-day SMA; CAT's earnings spike fully faded, still no re-entry |
| 2026-08-04 | 10 | ✅ No trades — cash in band; CAT re-buy rejected (>5% same-day spike); LIN add rejected (trend 1/5) |
| 2026-08-01 | 9 | ✅ Market closed (Sat) — reconciled clean |
| 2026-07-31 | 8 | ✅ Bought XLI + XLV ($50 each); completed invalidation/earnings migration |
| 2026-07-28 | 7 | ✅ Sold CAT (thesis break), bought SCHD |

## Known quirks

- **Cron `*/3` resets every month** — fires drift (Jul 28 → Jul 31 → Aug 1 → Aug 4)
  and land on weekends. Weekend fires are harmless (agent reconciles, defers trades).
  Recommended fix (owner action, in the claude.ai Routines UI): change the schedule to
  `0 15 * * 2,5` (Tue + Fri, 15:00 UTC) — always market days, steady ~3–4 day spacing.
